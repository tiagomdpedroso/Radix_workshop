## Running the examples
Before running the examples, you will need to install the [Scrypto toolchain](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/getting-started/install-scrypto.html) and an IDE that supports Rust. Radix recommends using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Rust extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust).

## Getting syntax highlighting in TX manifests
To enable syntax highlighting in the transactions manifest file (used in the 5th example) you can right-click the `rtm_color.vsix` file and select `Install extension VSIX`.
